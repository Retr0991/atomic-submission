# Design Strategy for Alerting & Notification Platform

This document outlines the guiding principles and design strategy for this codebase. It is intended for future reference and to help AI agents (e.g., Copilot, GPT) understand the architectural intent and extensibility goals.

## Core Principles

- **Object-Oriented Design:**
  - Use classes and interfaces to encapsulate business logic and promote reusability.
  - Favor composition and delegation over inheritance where possible.

- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Keep CRUD, delivery, reminders, analytics, and preferences in distinct services.
  - Controllers should be thin, delegating logic to services.

- **Strategy Pattern for Channels:**
  - Delivery channels (in-app, email, SMS, push) are implemented via the `ChannelStrategy` interface.
  - New channels can be added without modifying core delivery logic.

- **Extensibility:**
  - All major flows (delivery, reminders, persistence) are abstracted behind interfaces.
  - Adding new features (channels, reminder types, RBAC, escalations) should require minimal changes to existing code.

- **Type Safety & Validation:**
  - Use TypeScript types and Zod schemas for all inputs and core data shapes.
  - Validation logic should live in the validation layer, not controllers.

- **In-Memory Store for MVP:**
  - All data is stored in-memory for demo purposes.
  - Persistence can be swapped by replacing the data layer, with no changes to services.

- **Explicit API Surface:**
  - All endpoints are documented in README and architecture docs.
  - Request/response shapes are predictable and validated.

- **Future-Proofing:**
  - Scheduler logic is abstracted for easy integration with cron, queues, or background workers.
  - RBAC, authentication, and escalations are planned as extension points.

## Design Goals

- **Clarity:** Code should be readable, well-documented, and easy to onboard.
- **Modularity:** Each module should have a single responsibility and be easy to test.
- **Robustness:** Defensive coding practices (e.g., input validation, null checks) are encouraged.
- **Promptability:** This document is written to help AI agents understand the design intent and answer questions about architecture, extensibility, and best practices.

## How to Use This Document

- Reference this file when prompting AI agents for refactoring, feature additions, or architectural decisions.
- Update this file as the codebase evolves to reflect new principles or patterns.
